# Character Frequency Counter

This Python script analyzes a given string and counts the frequency of each character. It also provides a dictionary that maps each character to its frequency.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/character-frequency-counter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd character-frequency-counter
   ```

3. Open the script file `character_frequency_counter.py` and replace the `my_string` variable with your desired input string.

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python character_frequency_counter.py
   ```

## Usage

The script performs the following tasks:

1. It takes a string (`my_string`) as input.

2. It iterates through each character in the input string using a for loop and prints each character to the console.

3. It generates a dictionary (`my_dict`) where each key is a character from the input string, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in the string.

## Output

After running the script, you will see the following output:

```
d
e
n
i
s
k
a
s
a
l
a

{'d': 1, 'e': 1, 'n': 1, 'i': 1, 's': 2, 'k': 1, 'a': 3, 'l': 1}
```

The first part of the output displays each character from the input string on separate lines, and the second part shows the dictionary that maps each character to its frequency.
